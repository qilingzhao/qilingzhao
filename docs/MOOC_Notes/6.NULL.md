# 6.NULL:The Missing Semester of Your CS Education

## Lec1.Course overview + the shell

### Shell
```shell
cd - # will cd to the directory you were perviously in
>> # redirect STDOUT with append
| # take output of the program to the left and make input of the program to the right
```
### Permission
First, the d at the beginning of the line tells us that missing is a directory. Then follow three groups of three characters (rwx). These indicate what permissions the owner of the file (missing), the owning group (users), and everyone else respectively have on the relevant item.

## Lec2.Shell Tools and Scripting

### Shell Scripting

To assign variables in bash, use the syntax `foo=bar` and access the value of variable  with `$foo`. (Note that `foo = bar` will not work, in general, in shell script the space character will perform argument splitting) 



Strings delimited with `'`' are literal strings and will not subsitute variable values where as `"`delimited strings will.

```shell
foo=bar
echo "$foo"
# bar
echo '$foo'
# $foo
```

a shell script file(mcd.sh):

```shell
mcdfunc () {
	echo "$0"
    mkdir -p "$1"
    cd "$1"
}
# > $ mcdfunc 123                                                                
# mcdfunc
# zhao70@laptop ~/123  
```

source命令也称“点命令”， 是bash的内部命令

```shell
source mcd.sh # execute the script in our shell and load it 
. mcd.sh
```

- `$0` - Name of the script
- `$1` to `$9` - Arguments to the script. `$1` is the first argument and so on.
- `$@` - All the arguments
- `$#` - Number of arguments
- `$?` - Return code of the previous command
- `$$` - Process identification number (PID) for the current script
- `!!` - Entire last command, including arguments. A common pattern is to execute a command only for it to fail due to missing permissions; you can quickly re-execute the command with sudo by doing `sudo !!`
- `$_` - Last argument from the last command. If you are in an interactive shell, you can also quickly get this value by typing `Esc` followed by `.`



**command substitution**:  get the output of a command as a variable.  Whenever you place `$( CMD )` it will execute `CMD`, get the output of the command and substitute it in place.
**process substitution**: `<( CMD )` will execute `CMD` and place the output in a temporary file and substitute the `<()` with that file’s name. This is useful when commands expect values to be passed by *file* instead of by *STDIN*. `diff <(ls foo) <(ls bar)`
